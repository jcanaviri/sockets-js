# Sockets

## **Definition**

A socket is a software endpoint that enables communication between two processes or programs over a network. It provides a bidirectional communication channel between a client and a server, allowing them to send and receive data in real-time. Sockets can be used for a variety of network applications, such as web browsing, email, file transfer, and real-time chat or gaming. They are an essential building block for many network protocols and applications, and are widely used in client-server architectures.
